      <h2>Professional Objective</h2>
      <p>
        Dedicated and hard working individual with excellent analytical and organizational skills.
        Enrolled with the University of Central Florida, I am currently working towards a
        Bachelor's degree in statistics. I excel with time management and prioritization; as well
        as, interpreting data streams and solving complex problems that need attention. My time
        in college has sharpened my ability to work with Microsoft Office and Excel, Tableau, and
        interpret C+ programming languages. I have limited work experience in the data analytic
        field as I am transitioning careers; however, I am highly motivated to learn and work as
        hard as needed to achieve my goals and your satisfaction.
